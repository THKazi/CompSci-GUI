------------------------------------------------------------------------


KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:

> Only main menu mute button works - (rest have been disabled to prevent overlapping music)

> Time flickers when updated

> Card removal feature is redundant - game changed in-dev to stop when stack is out.




PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS:

> Local session & cross-session score trackers

> PvE & PvP

> A better suite of sounds

> Improved card quality

> Links in the credits



COMMENTS:

> Score tracker interface exists, but has been commented out as it is not functional.

> Like Mr. Couckuyt had warned, I spent too much time on the "sprinkles" and not enough on the "cake".

> Time management was NOT on point here

> Kids, manage your extra-curriculars. Don't overload yourself.

> And spend time with friends - self-care is important.
